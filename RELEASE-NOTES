----------------------------------------------------------------------------
                Significant bug fixes
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) A fix was implemented to remove logic that was too restrictive in
RefineSchedule when deciding to compute overlaps between source and
destination patches that touch on their boundaries but do not overlap on
their interiors.  These overlaps need to be computed for patch data types
that are centered on the boundaries of cells (node, face, side, edge, etc.).
The GitHub pull request for this bug fix is at
https://github.com/llnl/SAMRAI/pull/312

This fix may cause changes to numerical results.  These changes should be
improvements to accuracy due to adding necessary overlaps that were missed
before the fix.

1) 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
                Details about what's changed
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) There have been some incremental additions of modern C++ features in
some of the important low-level classes in tbox and hier.  This includes
adding of constexpr and noexcept keywords in appropriate places, and
explicit defaulting of a number of constructors and destructors. 

An API change related to these changes is the removal of implicit converstion
from Index to IntVector via the IntVector constructor that takes an Index.
This constructor still exists, but is now declared explicit.  This removes
the implicit conversion that occured when an Index was passed into a function
that requires an IntVector.
